The files here are my solution, or possibly solutions if there was more than one way to skin the proverbial cat, to various end of chapter problems in the textbook "Data Structures & Algorithms in Python" by Michael Goodwin et al. 

The files are organized by chapter using a naming convention based on the exercise numbering in the book, which follows the format <exercise-type-identifier>-<chapter>-<exercise-number>. Additionally, to track the evolution of each solution,  a "_vN" is appended, where N = the version number of the file. 

So for example the first exercise, from the first chapter would be named "R-1.1_v1", where the leading "R" is part of the books naming convention for the type of exercise. In this case it stands for "Reinforcement". 

There are three of exercises at the end of each chapter:
  Reinforcement
  Creativity
  Project

So for Creativity problems the exercises are numbered C-<chapter>.<exercise-number> and Project exercises are numbered P-<chapter>-<exercise-number>.

The reason for the various versions is simply so I can track when I have approached each individual exercise in more than one manner. Version one of an exercises solution will be my initial run at the problem and the highest numbered version will (generally) be my final stab at a given exercise. This will also typically be the solution I have found that is the most streamlined for my current understanding of Python at the time the particular solution was created. This means it will not  necessarily be the best possible solution.

I tend to use a lot of debugging print statements while learning. These are self evident and are controlled by one or more DEBUG constants that be set to True or False to control whether they print to the stdout during a run or not. The final version of a solution to any given exercise will usually be a version identical to the previous version but will have any debugging print statements stripped out.
